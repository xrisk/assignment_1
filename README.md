# Operating Systems â€” Assignment 1

## Build

To build:

```
make
```

This will produce two binaries `Q1` and `Q2`.

## Run

### Question 1
```
./Q1 file.bin
```

this willl create a directory called Assignment in the current directory (if it does not already exist) and place a file called `file.bin` inside it with the contents reversed.

### Question 2

```
./Q2 Assignment/ file.bin Assignment/file.bin
```

Assignment/ is the directory to be checked, and file.bin and Assignment/file.bin are the two files to be checked.
